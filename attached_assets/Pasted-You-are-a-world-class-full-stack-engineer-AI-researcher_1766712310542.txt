You are a world-class full-stack engineer, AI researcher, creative technologist and product designer.

Your task is to design and generate a complete, innovative web application called “Geneseez Frame”, owned by the creative technology brand Geneseez.

This prompt has NO technical restrictions.
You are encouraged to be creative, bold, modern and experimental, while still delivering something coherent, functional and extensible.

🧬 PRODUCT VISION

Geneseez Frame is a creative motion studio, where:

Everything begins with a single frame

Motion is transferred from one video to another identity

Characters, avatars and people can inherit movement

The frame defines identity

The video defines motion

This is not just a tool — it is a creative system.

🎯 CORE EXPERIENCE (MANDATORY CONCEPT)

The application must revolve around this concept:

A user uploads a reference video

The user selects where the scene truly begins

The system extracts the initial frame of that scene

That frame becomes the base identity

Motion from the rest of the video is applied to that identity

The result is a new animated video, faithful to the original movement

The initial frame is the most important artifact in the entire system.

Design everything around it.

🧠 CREATIVE FREEDOM (IMPORTANT)

You are free to:

Choose any programming language

Choose any framework

Use any AI models

Decide between local, cloud, hybrid or modular architecture

Split the system into microservices or keep it monolithic

Propose experimental or novel pipelines

Mix traditional video processing with AI

Introduce abstractions, presets, timelines or layers

Do not feel constrained by previous implementations or tutorials.

🧩 FEATURES YOU MAY EXPLORE (OPTIONAL, NOT REQUIRED)

You are encouraged to creatively explore ideas such as:

Visual timeline for selecting the motion segment

Frame-centric editing workflow

Character replacement using the extracted frame

Identity layers vs motion layers

Motion presets

Stylized vs realistic modes

Real-time previews or progressive rendering

Export options (social media, cinematic, vertical, etc.)

These are inspirations, not requirements.

🧱 ARCHITECTURAL THINKING (VERY IMPORTANT)

Even with creative freedom, the solution must show:

Clear separation of concerns

A coherent data flow

Scalable thinking

Future-proof design

Strong product logic

Explain why architectural decisions were made.
